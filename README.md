# cloudy-sky

Cloudy Sky is a project to connect lots of instances of lots of cloud features.

Together they will create a useless but featureful machine, the goal being the journey of creating the machine rather than the done system.

Machine:
* Input: Invoke an API endpoint.
* Endpoint invokes a Lambda.
* Lambda puts event to EventBridge Bus.
